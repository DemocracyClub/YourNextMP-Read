        "extract": "Kenneth Harry Clarke CH QC (born 2 July 1940) is a British Conservative politician who has represented Rushcliffe in Nottinghamshire as Member of Parliament since 1970.\nClarke, one of the UK's best-known and popular politicians, was dubbed by the press with the affectionate nickname of \"Big Beast\". He served in various British Cabinets as Chancellor of the Exchequer, Home Secretary, Lord Chancellor and Justice Secretary, Education Secretary, Health Secretary and Minister without Portfolio. He has been the President of the Tory Reform Group since 1997.\nClarke contested the Conservative Party leadership three times \u2013 in 1997, 2001 and 2005 \u2013 being defeated each time. Opinion polls indicated he was more popular with the general public than with his Party, whose generally Euro-sceptic stance did not chime with his pro-European views. Notably, he is President of the Conservative Europe Group, Co-President of the pro-EU body British Influence and Vice-President of the European Movement UK.\nClarke's time as a Cabinet Minister is the fifth-longest in the modern era, having spent over 20 years serving under Prime Ministers Margaret Thatcher, John Major and David Cameron.\nFollowing his return to Parliament at the 2010 general election, Clarke became joint-second longest-serving MP (with three others). He intends to contest the 2015 General Election",
