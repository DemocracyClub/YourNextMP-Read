        "extract": "Terry Marsh (born 7 February 1958) is an English former professional boxer who was an undefeated world champion in the light welterweight division.\nMarsh was a three-time ABA senior amateur champion who went on to become the British, European and IBF light welterweight world champion as a professional. He was the first European boxer ever to retire as an undefeated World Champion, a feat later equalled by Romanian Michael Loewe, Germany's Sven Ottke and Welshman Joe Calzaghe.\nMarsh was charged with the attempted murder of his former manager, the boxing promoter, Frank Warren following Warren's shooting in London in 1989. Marsh spent 10 months on remand before he was released after being acquitted at trial.\nIn 2010, Marsh changed his name by deed poll to \"None Of The Above X\" and stood in the that year's general election as an independent candidate. He changed his name as a protest against there being no option to select \"None of the above\" in the election.\n^ Boxrec. \"Terry Marsh\". Boxrec Fighter Page.
