He is a native of the Lower Falls area of Belfast.\nLowry first stood for the Workers' Party in the Lagan Valley by-election, 1986. As the only candidate to challenge Jim Molyneaux of the Ulster Unionist Party, he picked up 9.3% of the vote.\nLowry stood again in Lagan Valley at the 1987 general election, but, facing several candidates, his vote dropped below 3%. For the 1992 general election he moved to contest Belfast West, and has contested this unsuccessfully at each subsequent election.\nLowry was also the Workers' Party's candidate in the Northern Ireland constituency at the European Parliament election in 1994, coming well down the field with only 0.45% of the votes cast. He topped the party's list in Belfast West for the Northern Ireland Forum election of 1996, and has contested the same seat at each election to the Northern Ireland Assembly. Lowry has also stood for Belfast City Council in the Lower Falls ward in each election since 1993.\nIn 2005, Lowry was one of three people to post bail for Workers' Party President Se\u00e1n Garland, but forfeited \u00a39,000 after Garland failed to appear in court.\nLowry is registered with the Electoral Commission as the leader and nominating officer of the Workers' Party in Northern Ireland.",
