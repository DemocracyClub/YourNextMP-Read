He currently writes a weekly column for The Guardian.\nOn 3 February 2012, Huhne resigned from the Cabinet when he was charged with perverting the course of justice over a 2003 speeding case. Vicky Pryce, at that time his wife, had claimed that she was driving the car at the time, and thus accepted the licence penalty points on his behalf. Chris Huhne denied the charge until the trial began on 4 February 2013, when he changed his plea to guilty, resigned as a member of parliament and left the Privy Council. He was sentenced to eight months in prison at Southwark Crown Court, along with his former wife Vicky Pryce, both for perverting the course of justice, on 11 March. He served 62 days of his sentence at HMP Leyhill before he was released.\nHuhne had twice stood unsuccessfully for election as Leader of the Liberal Democrats; in 2006 he came second to Sir Menzies Campbell and in 2007 he narrowly lost to Nick Clegg.",
