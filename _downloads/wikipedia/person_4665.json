In August 2014 he changed his political allegiance to UKIP and announced his resignation as an MP, thereby necessitating a by-election in which he stood and was returned as a UKIP MP. He explained that he was joining UKIP out of a desire to see \"fundamental change in British politics\" and because he believed \"many of those at the top of the Conservative Party are simply not on our side. They aren't serious about the change that Britain so desperately needs.\"",
