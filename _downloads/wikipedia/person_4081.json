He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Rotherham from 1994 to his resignation in 2012 and served in the Labour Government as Minister of State for Europe from 2002 until 2005.\nOn 2 November 2012, he was suspended from the Labour Party after the House of Commons Standards and Privileges Committee found that he had submitted 19 false invoices \"plainly intended to deceive\" the parliamentary expenses authority. Later that day he announced his intention to resign as MP for Rotherham.\nOn 9 October 2013, MacShane was removed from the Privy Council (and so lost the right to use the honorific 'The Right Honourable'). On 18 November 2013 he pleaded guilty to false accounting at the Old Bailey, by submitting false receipts for \u00a312,900, and on 23 December 2013, he was sentenced to six months imprisonment. He served his sentence in HM Prison Belmarsh and HM Prison Brixton.\n^ \"Rt Hon Denis MacShane\". House of Commons.
