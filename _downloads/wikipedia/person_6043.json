        "extract": "Callum McCaig is a Scottish National Party politician and a councillor on Aberdeen City Council for the Kincorth/Nigg/Cove ward, formerly called Kincorth/Loirston.\nBorn in Aberdeen, he graduated with an MA(Hons) in Politics at Edinburgh University and then worked for the SNP MSP, Maureen Watt as a Parliamentary Assistant.\nMcCaig was first elected in the Aberdeen City Council election, 2007, topping the polling in his ward with 1,883 first preferences and taking the first seat exceeding the quota. Following the election, the Scottish Liberal Democrats formed a coalition with the SNP to run the Council. On 23 May 2011 McCaig took over as leader of the SNP group on the council. After two by-election victories during 2011, the SNP became the largest party on the Council, and in June 2011, their then Council leader stepped down to become Deputy Council leader. As a result, Callum McCaig, who had been acting as Deputy Council leader, became the leader of the Council on 28 June 2011. At the time, at the age of 26 he was one of the youngest council leaders in all of the United Kingdom.\nHe was re-elected in the Aberdeen City Council election, 2012, polling 1,389 first preferences and topping the poll in the ward. After the elections he remained the group leader of an enlarged SNP delegation, but is no longer the Council leader as the Scottish Labour Party formed an administration with the support of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party and Independents.\nHis mother, Dorothy, was an unsuccessful candidate in the Lower Deeside ward.\n\n",
