She lives near Bellaghy, County Londonderry. She is married with three children; her father-in-law is former Vanguard politician Robert Overend. She worked in accountancy before taking up employment as office manager for her father Billy Armstrong MLA in 1998. Overend is the Ulster Unionist Party Women's Development Officer.\nOverend stood unsuccessfully in Mid Ulster at the 2010 UK general election, taking 11% of the vote and fourth place.\nSandra Overend has said that there must be an equitable solution found for Northern Ireland\u2019s dairy farmers or else the industry runs the risk of being strangled by low prices. She also said, \u201cWhilst Thursday\u2019s increase in the milk auction, 25.04ppl to 26.22ppl, is to be welcomed we must remember that exactly the same auction last year produced results of 29.53ppl. Therefore whilst milk prices may be rising from their cripplingly low 22ppl only a few months ago, they still have much further to go to simply match last year\u2019s prices.\n^ BBC News - Election 2011\n^ Ulster Unionist Party\n^ \"Election 2010: Mid Ulster\", BBC News\n^ \"Farminglife.com - Grocery Code Adjudicator could play role: MLA\".
