        "extract": "Mike Parker (born 1967, in Birmingham, Warwickshire) is a British travel writer, currently living in Wales.\nHe is the co-author of all five editions of the bestselling Rough Guide to Wales, and has also written books on four British cities, and on the gay scenes of Scotland, Ireland and Northern England. In addition, Parker has worked as a stand-up comedian.\nAfter moving to Wales in spring 2000, he became involved in television, writing and presenting a one-off Saint David's Day special for HTV Wales in 2002. This led to him being commissioned to write and present two series of Coast to Coast, where Mike took twelve journeys in different boats around the Welsh coast. He has since returned to dry land to make three series of the popular Great Welsh Roads for HTV Wales, which sees Parker and his dog Patsy tour the country in his camper van.",
