        "extract": "Trevor Lunn is an Alliance Party politician in Northern Ireland.\nHe was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly for Lagan Valley in the 2007 assembly election. Mr. Lunn took over the Alliance candidacy for Lagan Valley from Seamus Close, the longtime representative for the area. While many pundits predicted that Alliance would struggle to hold on to the seat, Mr Lunn's performance saw the new candidate being elected 4th out of 6 seat available. He retained the seat at the 2011 Assembly election. He is a former chairman of the Alliance Party.\nTrevor Lunn has been a councillor for Lisburn since 2001, serving as Deputy Mayor for the term 2005/6 and was elected as Mayor of the City of Lisburn on 22 June 2006.\nRegarding accusations of the Sinn F\u00e9in infiltrating primary schools, Lunn said, \"In the context of Lumen Christi as a highly successful grammar school which has taken a public stance on the question of academic selection, in defiance of the minister\u2019s instruction and indeed the view of the Catholic Church, it is hard to see these appointments as anything other than a means of infiltration of the school\u2019s board of governors, with the aim of influencing the stance taken by the present board.\"",
