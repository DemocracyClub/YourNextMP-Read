For others, see Parmjit Singh (disambiguation).\nParmjit Singh Gill (born 20 December 1966 in Leicester) is a British Liberal Democrat politician. As Member of Parliament for Leicester South from 2004 to 2005, he is the only ever ethnic-minority Liberal Democrat MP.\nHe was first elected as Liberal Democrat councillor for the Stoneygate Ward in Leicester and was elected to the House of Commons at the Leicester South by-election on 15 July 2004. He contested the seat again at the 2005 general election, but this time came second to the Labour Party candidate, Sir Peter Soulsby. He continued to serve as councillor for Leicester City Council's Stoneygate Ward until defeated in May 2011.\nHe was initially selected to run as the Lib-Dem candidate for the 2011 Leicester South by-election after Sir Peter Soulsby stood down to run for Mayor for Leicester. However he stood down after a short time citing family pressures. He was replaced by the Lib-Dem candidate Zuffar Haq.\nHe works as a local authority Information Management and Security Consultant for Charnwood Borough Council. Prior to that he worked as a Data Protection Administrator for Leicester City Council.\n^ [1]",
