        "extract": "Michael Thomas Hancock, CBE (born 9 April 1946) is a British politician. He is currently an independent Member of Parliament (MP) for Portsmouth South.\nHancock formally resigned from the Liberal Democrat whip in early June 2014 until a civil court action brought against him by a female constituent alleging improper conduct was resolved. An out-of-court settlement with the woman, known only as 'Annie', was reached later in June 2014 in which Hancock admitted that he \"crossed the line\" into inappropriate behaviour. Hancock's resignation was announced on 18 September 2014.\nHe stood as an independent candidate in the 2014 Portsmouth City Council elections and lost his seat in Fratton Ward to UKIP candidate Julie Swan. The Liberal Democrats lost overall control of the council.\nThere has been speculation that Hancock will run as an Independent candidate in the 2015 General Election. Under the terms of the Parliamentary Resettlement Grant, if he announces he will not be standing as a candidate he will not receive any redundancy pay-out, whereas, as the incumbent, if he fights and loses his seat in the election he would be eligible to receive six months\u2019 MPs salary (the first \u00a330,000 tax-free).\nHancock was previously the Member of Parliament for Portsmouth South for the SDP following a by-election in 1984 until 1987.",
