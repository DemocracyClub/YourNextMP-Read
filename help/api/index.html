<p>
The data that's submitted to this site is available as a CSV/Excel download and
programmatically via a RESTful web service called PopIt, which
stores information about people and their positions in
organizations. (You can <a href="http://popit.poplus.org/">find
out more about PopIt here</a>.)

The base API URL for the data is:

<h2>Find a Constituency ID</h2>

<p>In order to look up candidates for a constituency, you have
to find the ID of that constituency. The IDs that we use for
constituencies are the IDs for Westminster constituencies areas
in another web
service, <a href="http://mapit.mysociety.org">MapIt</a>.</p>

<h3>... from a postcode</h3>

<p>Suppose you want to find the constituency for the postcode
SW1A&nbsp;1AA, then you would make a GET request to the
following URL:</p>

<pre class="code-sample"><a href="http://mapit.mysociety.org/postcode/SW1A1AA">http://mapit.mysociety.org/postcode/SW1A1AA</a>
</pre>

<p>This <a href="http://mapit.mysociety.org/postcode/SW1A1AA">returns
a JSON object</a>, wherein the constituency ID can be found
at <tt>.shortcuts.WMC</tt>.</p>

<p>There's more documentation available
on <a href="http://mapit.mysociety.org/#api-by_postcode">postcode
lookups on the MapIt front-page</a>.</p>

<h3>... from a latitude / longitude or other coordinate</h3>

<p>You can look up constituencies in MapIt using a variety of
coordinate systems. To give the most common example, you might
have a WGS84 coordinate from a GPS or location API, in which can
you should put the SRID 4326 in your lookup. For example,
latitude
52.205083 and longitude 0.115194 could be looked up with:</p>

<pre class="code-sample"><a href="http://mapit.mysociety.org/point/4326/0.115194,52.205083?type=WMC">http://mapit.mysociety.org/point/4326/0.115194,52.205083?type=WMC</a>
</pre>

(Note that the longitude comes before the latitude, which might
not be what you expect.) The only key in that object is the
constituency ID.

<p>There's more documentation available
on <a href="http://mapit.mysociety.org/#api-by_point">point
lookups on the MapIt front-page</a>.</p>

<h3>... by selecting it from its name</h3>

If you need to produce a list of all constituencies (e.g. for a
select box) and allow the user to pick one, you can get a list
of all Westminster constituencies in the UK from this request:

<pre class="code-sample"><a href="http://mapit.mysociety.org/areas/WMC">http://mapit.mysociety.org/areas/WMC</a>
</pre>

<p>The <a href="http://mapit.mysociety.org/areas/WMC">returned
data from that request</a> has the constituency ID as its keys;
the values are objects that include (among other things)
a <tt>name</tt> element that gives you the official name of the
constituency.</p>

<h2>Find Candidates for a Constituency</h2>

<p>There are broadly two ways you can approach getting candidate
data for a constituency; one is slightly simpler, and just gives
you the basic candidate and party information, while the second
gives you the full data in Popolo format, which is more complex
but useful if you're using tools that generically process Popolo
data.</p>

<h3>Simpler (Basic candidate information)</h3>

<p>You can get all the candidates for a constituency, both in
2010 and 2015 by a query like:

</p><pre class="code-sample">http://yournextmp.popit.mysociety.org/api/v0.1/posts/CONSTITUENCY_ID?embed=membership.person
</pre>

<p>
For example, for Dulwich and West Norwood,
<a href="http://yournextmp.popit.mysociety.org/api/v0.1/posts/65808?embed=membership.person">these
would be the results</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you iterate over the <tt>memberships</tt> in that result,
each person will look something like:
</p>

<pre>"person_id": {
  "id": "2009",
  "birth_date": null,
  "email": "....@example.org",
  "gender": "female",
  "name": "Tessa Jowell",
  "party_memberships": {
    "2010": {
      "id": "party:53",
      "name": "Labour Party"
    }
  },
  "standing_in": {
    "2010": {
      "mapit_url": "http://mapit.mysociety.org/area/65808",
      "name": "Dulwich and West Norwood",
      "post_id": "65808"
    },
    "2015": null
  },
</pre>

<p>(I've removed some fields there to keep the example simpler.)
The two fields of particular interest are
probably <tt>standing_in</tt> and <tt>party_memberships</tt>.
</p>

<h4>standing_in</h4>

<p>This object will only have keys '2010' or '2015'. If one of
these keys is present then we have known information about the
candidate for the UK general election in that year.  If the
value is <tt>null</tt> then we know that they're <em>not</em>
standing. If they are (or were) standing in the general election
in that year then there will be a dictionary giving you details
of the constituency they were standing in. So, in the example
above we can see that Tessa Jowell stood in 2010 in Dulwich and
West Norwood, but we know isn't standing in any consituency
in 2015.</p>

<h4>party_memberships</h4>

<p>This object will similarly only have keys '2010' or '2015'
and tells you what party the candidate is / was standing for in
the general election of that year.  So in the example above, you
can see that Tessa Jowell stood for the Labour Party in 2010,
but has no entry for 2015 (because, as the <tt>standing_in</tt>
tells us) she's not standing in 2015.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>More complex (Full Popolo information)</h3>

<p>
All the candidates we know about for a constituency can be
returned by making a GET request to a URL of this form, where
you should substitute in the constituency ID for
CONSTITUENCY_ID:

</p><pre class="code-sample">http://yournextmp.popit.mysociety.org/api/v0.1/posts/CONSTITUENCY_ID?embed=membership.person.membership.organization
</pre>

<p>For example, for Dulwich and West Norwood,
<a href="http://yournextmp.popit.mysociety.org/api/v0.1/posts/65808?embed=membership.person.membership.organization">these
would be the results</a>. To explain further, that's showing information about the <em>post</em>
"MP for Dulwich and West Norwood". Under the <tt>memberships</tt> key of the
<tt>result</tt> dictionary you can find all memberships of this
post - those that have the <tt>role</tt> "Candidate" were
candidates at one point.</p>

<p>You should then look at the start and end dates of that
membership, which will tell you whether they're a candidate for
the 2015 election or were a past candidate for the 2010
election:</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr><td>Election</td><td>start_date</td><td>end_date</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015</td><td>2010-05-07</td><td>9999-12-31</td></tr>
<tr><td>2010</td><td>2005-05-06</td><td>2010-05-06</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

Under <tt>person_id</tt> attribute of each of those membership
you can find information about that candidate, like their name,
contact details and (in another nested <tt>memberships</tt>
object) their memberships of political parties. The party
memberships use the same date values as above to indicate
whether it's their party membership at the 2010 or 2015 election.
<p></p>

<h2>Find a candidate by name</h2>

You can use the <tt>search/persons</tt> endpoint with a query
paramter like <tt>q=name:"John Doe"</tt>.

<pre class="code-sample">http://yournextmp.popit.mysociety.org/api/v0.1/search/persons?q=name:%22FULL%20NAME%22
</pre>

<p>For example, you can find every David Jones in the database
with <a href="http://yournextmp.popit.mysociety.org/api/v0.1/search/persons?q=name:%22david%20jones%22">this
query</a>. As above, the <tt>standing_in</tt>
and <tt>party_memberships</tt> elements will give you details
about which constituencies they are / were standing in, and for which
parties.

</p><h2>Get all known 2015 candidates</h2>

<p>You can also use the <tt>search/persons</tt> endpoint to find
all the candidates that we think are standing in 2015,
with <a href="http://yournextmp.popit.mysociety.org/api/v0.1/search/persons?q=_exists_:standing_in.2015.post_id ">this
query</a>:</p>

<pre class="code-sample">http://yournextmp.popit.mysociety.org/api/v0.1/search/persons?q=_exists_:standing_in.2015.post_id
</pre>

Club Google Group</a>, which may be of interest if you're developing
